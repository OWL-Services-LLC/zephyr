   :name: SDLL basic sample application
   :relevant-api: sdll_api

   Receives an input from stdin and prints the resulting frame in hexadecimal
   format

Overview
********

A simple application that can be used with any :ref:`supported board <boards>`
that shows how to use SDLL to create a serialized data frame.

This example can be used as a basis for implementing SDLL to validate any
serialized data sent to an external device (UART, SPI, I2C, etc.) using CRC-16
as the frame verification method.
